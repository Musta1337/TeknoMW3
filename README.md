## Notice
- It is preferable that you find information and everything in the [TeknoMW3's Forum](#teknomw3-links), since this is where everything will be really updated.
- This repository doesn't contain any TeknoMW3 code, it just provides support and help to English speaking users.
  - If you don't know English, you can use [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) as an English to X Language Translator. If you know Spanish, you can visit the [SoyRA Repository](https://github.com/SoyRA/TeknoMW3).
- **TeknoGods** (and therefore TeknoMW3) doesn't support piracy, this means they won't be able to give you base game files (like DLC, Update 1.4.382 or 1.9.446, etc.).
